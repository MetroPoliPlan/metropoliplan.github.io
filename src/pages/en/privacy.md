# Privacy Policy

## Who we are

Our website address is: https://www.metropoliplan.org.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the website, we collect the data displayed in the comment form, as well as the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to facilitate spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The privacy policy for the Gravatar service can be found here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. Once your comment has been approved, your profile picture will be visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

When uploading images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our website, you can choose to store your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you don't have to re-enter your details when you leave another comment. These cookies last for one year.

When you visit our login page, we set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie does not contain any personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to remember your login information and your screen display options. Login cookies last for two days and screen options for one year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will last for two weeks. When you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

When you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie is stored in your browser. This cookie does not contain any personal data and only displays the post ID of the item you have just edited. It expires after 1 day.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may contain embedded content (e.g., videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if the visitor had visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## Analytics

### Who we share your information with

In fact, we don't share the data with anyone outside the project. All data is used only for the intended purpose (planning and assignment of shifts). No personal data will be passed on. It is limited to the respective tenant and cannot be viewed by other tenants.

Analysis data can be collected. But then only in anonymized form only for troubleshooting.

### How long we keep your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata will be retained indefinitely. This allows us to automatically detect and approve all follow-up comments instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users who register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can view, edit or delete their personal data at any time (except that they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also view and edit this information.

### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this website or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we delete any personal data we hold about you. This does not apply to data that we are required to retain for administrative, legal or security purposes.

### Where we send your data

Visitor comments can be checked via an automated spam detection service.

### Your contact information

Send an email to: team (-at-) metropoliplan.org

## Additional information

### How we protect your data

We use state-of-the-art security design principles and strictly adhere to the Global General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information, please also refer to MEtropoliplan's privacy policy, accessible from the main menu.

All data is encrypted during transport and at rest (e.g. SSL, database encryption, etc.)

### What data breach procedures we have in place

In the event of a data breach, all tenant administrators are informed to communicate the next necessary steps to the user.

### From which third parties we receive data

We do not receive any additional data from 3rd parties.

### What automated decision-making and/or profiling we do with user data

At the website level, there is no automated decision-making or profiling. Within MEtropoliPlan, we have an automated mapping robot.

### Industry Disclosure Requirements

This does not apply to this website or to the MEtropoliplan software.
