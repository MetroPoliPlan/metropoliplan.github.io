# What is Metropoliplan (MEP)

## Purpose of Metropoliplan

Metropoliplan was developed for the special needs of public witnessing in metropolitan regions. In addition, processes for witnessing at rest areas have also been integrated.  

This software is NOT intended for congregation-level witnessing carts. A simple Google Spreadsheet or Excel Online is much easier here, as the groups can then organize themselves.

Metropoliplan's target groups are specifically organizational teams that have to coordinate large projects with many congregations. On these scales, self-organization no longer works and requires more control.
