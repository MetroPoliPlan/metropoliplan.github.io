        <p>
            When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown
            in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser
            user agent string to help spam detection.

        <p>
            An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a
            hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are
            using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
            https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment,
            your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your
            comment.

        <h2>
            <strong>Embedded content from other websites</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos,
            images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites
            behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the
            other website.
        </p>

        <p>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
            additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
            that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
            embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
            website.

        <h2><strong>Analytics</strong></h2>

        <h2>
            <strong>Who we share your data with</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Actually we share the data with no one outside of the project. All
            data is only used for the intended purpose (planning and assignments
            of shifts). No personal data is shared. It is limited to the
            respective tenant and also not visible from other tenants.
        </p>

        <p>
            Analytics data may be gathered. But then only in anonymized form for
            troubleshooting purposes only.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>How long we retain your data</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
            indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
            comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
            queue.
        </p>

        <p>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
            personal information they provide in their user profile. All users
            can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time
            (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators
            can also see and edit that information.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>What rights you have over your data</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can
            request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold
            about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also
            request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does
            not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative,
            legal, or security purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <strong>What data breach procedures we have in place</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            In case of a databreach all tenant administrators get informed to be
            able to communicate the next necessary steps to the user.

                data</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
            At Website level there is no automated decision making or profiling
            in place. Within Metropoliplan we have an automated assignment
            robot.
